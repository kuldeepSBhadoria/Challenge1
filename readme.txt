   ****  IDE used WebStrom for this Project ***

   The target of this programme is to make a function that takes an Array as argument
   and returns odd array without using for loop and inbuilt loops.
   So first thing arise that how to iterate that array like loop but not use loop.
   I think about recursive function where function calls itself till some conditions.
   then I got idea that timeout function which can call a function.
   So implemented logic using $timeout that is inbuilt function of Angular . by passing 0 means
   calling this function with no delay.and finally I created a function calling itself.
